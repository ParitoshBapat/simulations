# A function to simulate comorbid ylds

  # A data object to store the simulated cases

  
  # Iterate through each disease and compute YLDs -- store result in sim_data

    # Compute a simulated # of cases and YLDs

  
  # Compute unadjusted, adjusted YLDs


# Try passing the data to your function


# Repeat 1000 times because of randomness

# Graph variation in results (histogram of all_unadjusted)

# Show overall impact (histogram of all_adjusted / all_unadjusted)
